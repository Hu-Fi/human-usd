# Human USD token - Automated market making ERC20 example

This project demonstrates the ERC20 token example, which launches market making campaigns on Human Protocol.
The token is deployed and initialized with some campaign configurations that includes:
- Campaign oracle addresses (exchange, recording, reputation), with its fee percentage for each oracle.
- Campaign manifest data which exists off-chain. This indicates the token pair (ETH-HUSD), which needs liquidity on CEX/DEX.
- Several campaign tiers. For this initial version, we are expecting to launch campaigns that pays providers in terms of HMT/ETH/USDT/USDC.
